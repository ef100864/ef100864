      <h2>Cargo Planes</h2>

      <h3>
        Cargo planes are designed to transport goods and materials. They are often operated by shipping companies like DHL and FedEx. 
        Unlike passenger planes, cargo planes typically have high-mounted wings to optimize long-distance flight and cargo space. 
        The largest cargo plane ever built was the Antonov An-225 Mriya, with a wingspan of 88.4 meters, wider than a football field.

      <h2>Passenger Planes</h2>

      <h3>
        Passenger planes are used to transport people and are equipped with features to ensure safety and comfort. 
        Operated by airlines, these planes often have low-mounted wings for stability and efficiency. 
        The largest passenger plane is the Airbus A380, capable of carrying up to 853 passengers.

      <h2>Military Planes</h2>

      <h3>
        Military planes are used by air forces for defense and combat missions. 
        Their designs, often with mid-mounted wings, prioritize speed and maneuverability. 
        Pilots require specialized training to operate these aircraft due to their advanced systems and weaponry. 
        The fastest military plane is the Lockheed Martin X-15A-2, reaching speeds of Mach 6.7.
