  <h2>What are planes?</h2>
  
  <h3>
    A plane is a type of vehicle that we use in our everyday lives. Planes are the only form of public transportation that can travel across countries and continents quickly. Planes have different uses: some are used for transporting cargo, others for passenger travel, and many are used for military purposes. These planes are modified according to their specific roles. The picture above shows the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380.
